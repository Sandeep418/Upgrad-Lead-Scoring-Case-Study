Problem Statement

 An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals.
On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses. They have process of form filling on their website after which the company that individual as a lead.
Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc.Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not. 
The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%. Now, this means if, say, they acquire 100 leads in a day, only about 30 of them are converted. To make this process more efficient, 
the company wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as Hot Leads.If they successfully identify this set of leads, the lead conversion rate should go up as the sales 
team will now be focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls to everyone

Business Objective

Lead X has tasked us with developing a predictive model capable of assigning a lead score ranging from 0 to 100 to each prospective lead. This initiative aims to enable Lead X to identify and prioritize "hot" leads effectively, thereby enhancing their overall lead conversion rate. The ultimate goal set by the CEO is to achieve a lead conversion rate of 80%.

In addition to optimizing current lead conversion rates, the model is expected to adapt to future constraints and demands. This includes anticipating peak time actions required for maximum efficiency, optimizing manpower utilization, and providing strategic guidance post-achievement of the conversion target. Our approach will focus on developing a scalable and adaptable model that aligns with Lead X's long-term business objectives.
